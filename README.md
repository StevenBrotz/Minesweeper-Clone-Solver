# Minesweeper-Clone-Solver
Minesweeper clone and solver written in C++

Minesweeper game and solver with graphics made using SDL

The idea is to have a minesweeper game where if you need help, you can have the solver make a move for you. Click the lightbulb on the top bar to have the solver make a move. Needless to say, the solver uses only the information available to player to make its moves; it can't see unrevealed tiles.
